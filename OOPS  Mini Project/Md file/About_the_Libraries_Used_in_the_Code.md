# About the Libraries Used in the Code

## Detailed Explanation of All the Libraries Used in the Code:

### 1. `qrcode`

- **Purpose:**
  - Used to generate QR codes based on user-provided data (e.g., text, URLs).

- **Key Components in the Code:**
  - `QRCode`: A class for configuring and generating QR codes.

- **Parameters:**
  - `version`: Controls the size of the QR code.
  - `error_correction`: Error correction level (e.g., low, medium, high).
  - `box_size`: Size of each box in the QR code grid.
  - `border`: Thickness of the border.

- **Methods:**
  - `make_image()`: Creates a PIL image of the QR code.

- **Installation:**
  - Use `pip install qrcode[pil]`.

### 2. `tkinter`

- **Purpose:**
  - The standard Python library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

- **Key Components in the Code:**

  - **Widgets:**
    - `Tk`: The main window of the application.
    - `Label`: Displays text or images in the UI.
    - `Entry`: A field for user input.
    - `Button`: Interactive buttons for user actions.
    - `Canvas`: A widget for drawing shapes or creating custom designs (used for the gradient background).
    - `Frame`: A container to group widgets.

  - **Dialog Components:**
    - `messagebox`: Displays pop-up messages (e.g., errors, warnings, confirmations).
    - `filedialog`: Opens a dialog for file saving.

### 3. `Pillow (PIL)`

- **Purpose:**
  - A popular Python library for image processing.

- **Key Components in the Code:**
  - `Image`: Handles images in various formats.
  - `ImageTk`: A module to convert images into a format that `tkinter` can use (e.g., displaying QR codes in the GUI).

- **Installation:**
  - Use `pip install pillow`.

### 4. `ttk` (Part of `tkinter`)

- **Purpose:**
  - Provides themed widgets for a more modern look.

- **Key Components in the Code:**
  - `Progressbar`: A widget that provides visual feedback about an ongoing process (e.g., generating a QR code).

---

### 5. `time`

- **Purpose:**
  - Provides functions to handle time-related tasks (e.g., delays).

- **Key Components in the Code:**
  - `sleep`: Introduces a delay in the program (used to simulate progress bar updates).

---

### 6. `os` (Implicitly Used by File Operations)

- Although not directly imported here, file operations (e.g., saving a QR code) internally rely on Pythonâ€™s `os` module to interact with the file system.

---

### 7. Optional Utilities

- **Clipboard Functionality via `tkinter`:**
  - Enables copying text from the app to the clipboard.
